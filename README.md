# ml-cookbook
Welcome to my Machine learning cookbook repository! Here, I keep all of the code that I used for my Medium articles. Each folder contains notebooks that can be run in the Google Colab for the respective articles.

## drug_discovery_with_gnnas
The folder contains notebooks for Medium articles on drug discovery with GNNs

1) [Drug Discovery with Graph Neural Networks — part 1 (solubility)](https://towardsdatascience.com/drug-discovery-with-graph-neural-networks-part-1-1011713185eb)

2) [Drug Discovery with Graph Neural Networks — part 2 (toxicity)](https://towardsdatascience.com/drug-discovery-with-graph-neural-networks-part-2-b1b8d60180c4)

3) [Drug Discovery with Graph Neural Networks — part 3 (explainability)](https://towardsdatascience.com/drug-discovery-with-graph-neural-networks-part-3-c0c13e3e3f6d)

## kmeans_and_gms
The folder contains the code for [Gaussian Mixture Models vs K-Means. Which One to Choose?](https://towardsdatascience.com/gaussian-mixture-models-vs-k-means-which-one-to-choose-62f2736025f0) article.

## graph_generation
The folder contains the code for articles on graph generation methods.

1) [Generative Graph Models with NetworkX](https://github.com/KacperKubara/ml-cookbook/edit/master/README.md)
